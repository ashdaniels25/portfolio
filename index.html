            <p> Hi, I am Ash and I am on a journey from career changing from proffesional services to becoming a junior Developer.
                My first experince with coding was when I decided to buy a coding for kids maagazine and became fascinated. 
                I then decided to take the plunge and join Manchester Codes and follow a structured 24-week bootcamp to help aid my goal of career changing to a Junior Software Engineer.
